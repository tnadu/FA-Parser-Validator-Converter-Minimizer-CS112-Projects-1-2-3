# CS112 Project 1 - DFA parser and validator
__Exercise 1.__ Implement a library/program in a programming language of
your choosing to load and validate a DFA input file.

__Exercise 2.__ Implement a library/program in a programming language of
your choosing to test acceptance of a DFA - loaded from a DFA config file.

# CS112 Project 2 - NFA parser, validator and converter
__Exercise 1.__ Extend the library/program you implemented in Lab 1 to load
and validate an NFA input file.

__Exercise 2.__ Implement a library/program in a programming language of your 
choosing to test acceptance of an NFA - loaded from an NFA config file.

__Exercise 3.__ Implement a library/program in a programming language of your
choosing to convert an NFA - loaded from an NFA config file, to a DFA.

# CS112 Project 3 - DFA minimizer
__Exercise 1.__ Implement a library/program in a programming language of your
choosing to simulate the Myhill-Nerode theorem - minimize a DFA to the
smallest DFA with the same level of completeness.
